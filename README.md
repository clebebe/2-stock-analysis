# Stock Analysis

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis is to compare how refactoring the code affects the efficiency in a large set of data. In particular, this code will calculate the total daily volume and return of a number of stocks in a large data set using arrays and `for` loops. 

## Results

### Module Script
Module script was built using `for` loops and single variables. Loop went through each ticker, calculating volume, starting price, and ending price, then immediately printed out each value into the worksheet. This code took 0.5 seconds, as shown in below screenshot.
